# questtree
Quest Dependency Tree builder / procgen RPG

Originally done as a ProcJam 2019 Entry, and hopefully will get some iteration for [ProcJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/procjam)

**Idea/Goal:**
Programmatically generate quests in the form of a dependency tree, with subquests, etc. 

**MVP**
An familiar feeling minimal quest with reasonably appropriate descriptions of needs.

**Bonus Pts**
Some dialog and characters to fill in a story?
